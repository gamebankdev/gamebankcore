# Building Gamebank

## Compile-Time Options (cmake)

### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release/Debug]

Specifies whether to build with or without optimization and without or with
the symbol table for debugging. Unless you are specifically debugging or
running tests, it is recommended to build as release.

### LOW_MEMORY_NODE=[OFF/ON]

Builds gamebankd to be a consensus-only low memory node. Data and fields not
needed for consensus are not stored in the object database.  This option is
recommended for witnesses and seed-nodes.

### CLEAR_VOTES=[ON/OFF]

Clears old votes from memory that are no longer required for consensus.

### BUILD_GAMEBANK_TESTNET=[OFF/ON]

Builds gamebank for use in a private testnet. Also required for building unit tests.

### SKIP_BY_TX_ID=[OFF/ON]

By default this is off. Enabling will prevent the account history plugin querying transactions 
by id, but saving around 65% of CPU time when reindexing. Enabling this option is a
huge gain if you do not need this functionality.


## Building on Ubuntu 16.04

For Ubuntu 16.04 users, after installing the right packages with `apt` Gamebank
will build out of the box without further effort:

    # Required packages
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        autoconf \
        automake \
        cmake \
        g++ \
        git \
        libbz2-dev \
        libsnappy-dev \
        libssl-dev \
        libtool \
        make \
        pkg-config \
        python3 \
        python3-jinja2

    # Boost packages (also required)
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        libboost-chrono-dev \
        libboost-context-dev \
        libboost-coroutine-dev \
        libboost-date-time-dev \
        libboost-filesystem-dev \
        libboost-iostreams-dev \
        libboost-locale-dev \
        libboost-program-options-dev \
        libboost-serialization-dev \
        libboost-signals-dev \
        libboost-system-dev \
        libboost-test-dev \
        libboost-thread-dev

    # Optional packages (not required, but will make a nicer experience)
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        doxygen \
        libncurses5-dev \
        libreadline-dev \
        perl

    git clone https://github.com/gamebankdev/gamebankcore.git
    cd gamebankcore
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j$(nproc) gamebankd
    make -j$(nproc) cli_wallet
    # optional
    make install  # defaults to /usr/local


## Building on Windows(todo)

## Building on macOS X

Install Xcode and its command line tools by following the instructions here:
https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode.  In OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
and newer, you will be prompted to install developer tools when running a
developer command in the terminal.

Accept the Xcode license if you have not already:

    sudo xcodebuild -license accept

Install Homebrew by following the instructions here: http://brew.sh/

### Initialize Homebrew:

    brew doctor
    brew update

### Install gamebank dependencies:

    brew install \
        autoconf \
        automake \
        cmake \
        git \
        boost160 \
        libtool \
        openssl \
        snappy \
        zlib \
        python3
        
    pip3 install --user jinja2
    
Note: brew recently updated to boost 1.61.0, which is not yet supported by
gamebank. Until then, this will allow you to install boost 1.60.0.

*Optional.* To use TCMalloc in LevelDB:

    brew install google-perftools

*Optional.* To use cli_wallet and override macOS's default readline installation:

    brew install --force readline
    brew link --force readline

### Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/gamebankdev/gamebankcore.git
    cd gamebankcore

### Compile

    export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2h_1/
    export BOOST_ROOT=$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/boost@1.60/1.60.0/
    export SNAPPY_LIBRARIES=$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/snappy/1.1.7_1/lib/
    export SNAPPY_INCLUDE_DIR=$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/snappy/1.1.7_1/include/
    export ZLIB_LIBRARIES=$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/zlib/1.2.11/lib/
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DBOOST_ROOT="$BOOST_ROOT" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)

Also, some useful build targets for `make` are:

    gamebankd
    cli_wallet

e.g.:

    make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu) gamebankd

This will only build `gamebankd`.
