# gamebankcore - A Public Chain for Autonomous Game Ecosystem

Welcome to the gamebank source code repository!

gamebank public chain is developed and maintained by Gamebank Team. 

This code is currently alpha-quality and under rapid development. That said, there is plenty early experimenters can do, including running a private single node test network, transfering tokens, posting articles/comments and so on.

There is no public testnet running currently but it will coming soon.

## Supported Operating Systems
gamebank currently supports the following operating systems:  
1. Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04 (Ubuntu 16.04 recommended)
2. MacOS Darwin 10.11 and higher

## Getting Started
Instructions detailing the process of getting the software, building it, running a simple test network that produces blocks, transfer tokens and so on can be found on the at documentation(https://github.com/gamebankdev/gamebankcore/tree/dev/doc) for this GitHub repository.
